## prereqs

Here's what you'll need to run these scripts:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/)
- Requests (run 'pip install requests' (no quotes) in Terminal, PowerShell, etc.)
- The files on your own system

## how to run

1. Navigate your terminal/powershell/etc to the location of the files.
2. Run the script!
    1. Windows: 'filename.py'
    2. Mac: 'python ./filename.py'
    3. Linux: 'python ./filename.py'
3. To stop the script, either hit Control-C or simply close the terminal.
